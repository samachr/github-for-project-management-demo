# github-for-project-management-demo

Github is pretty good for scrum project management.

Project (Sprint)
====

A sprint is mapped to an organization level project. The sprint contains work we commit to get done during each two week period. To do and in progress are pretty straightforward -- they do what they say they do.

The done column is for work that is completely released and works. Work cannot move to done without a code review, merge, and release.
