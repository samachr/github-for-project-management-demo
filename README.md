Github can be an effective tool for agile project management.

Project (Sprint)
====

A sprint is mapped to an organization level project. The sprint contains work we commit to get done during each two week period. To do and in progress are pretty straightforward -- they do what they say they do.

Definition of Done
==
Issues cannot move to done without an approved code review, merge into master, and released. This ensures that no work is drifting between sprints and creating hidden work. The greatest value here will be increased dependability of the development team.
